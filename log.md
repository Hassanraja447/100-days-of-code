# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 18. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started to build fcc technical documentation page.

**Thoughts:** It looked very simple at first and I thoght I would complete it in hour or two. But its layout is not as simple as it look. 
Another thing that I have noticed about myself is that, I really try to copy everything on the example page, Which is  bad I think. Will continue it tommorrow.

### Day 2: September 19. Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Make some progress on technical page.

**Thoughts:** Sidebar is taking much of time. It have to be fixed and scrollable, and I haven't been able to do even one of them. Will learn two css props, position and overflow. Hope it will help be fixed sidebar as I wanted it to be.

Oh!!! And I also fixed a typo in fcc curriculum on github. :)

### Day 3: September 20. Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Technical documentation project

**Thoughts:** In the morning, learned two css props, position and overflow. After that sidebar was fixed just in minutes. Writing documentation text on my own is not possible and copying it is also not easy. It is taking some time. But thanks Allah all the hard work is done now.

### Day 4: September 21. Friday
**Today's Progress**: Started preparing for HTML5 test, Added content in technical documentation page, Learned about length units, detailed intro to CSS grids. Also learned how to stay focus and deep while working. Learned pomodoro technique (25 minutes work/ 5 minutes break) Work on only one related task a time.

**Thoughts:** A long day concluded. Soon after learning technique, workflow jumped to a high. It is not easy to work that long but I managed to stay motivated. Hope this method will speed up work termendously.
